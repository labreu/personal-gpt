      "content": "Certainly! Below is a simple Python implementation of the Fibonacci sequence. This code allows you to generate the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number of terms.\n\n### Fibonacci Sequence Code\n\n```python\ndef fibonacci(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generate the Fibonacci sequence up to n terms.\n\n    :param n: Number of terms in the Fibonacci sequence to generate.\n    :return: A list containing the Fibonacci sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    sequence = []\n    a, b = 0, 1\n    for _ in range(n):\n        sequence.append(a)\n        a, b = b, a + b\n    return sequence\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    terms = int(input(\"Enter the number of terms in the Fibonacci sequence: \"))\n    fibonacci_series = fibonacci(terms)\n    print(f\"Fibonacci sequence up to {terms} terms: {fibonacci_series}\")\n```\n\n### How it works:\n1. The `fibonacci` function takes an integer `n`, which is the number of terms you want in the Fibonacci sequence.\n2. It initializes the first two numbers of the Fibonacci sequence (0 and 1) and then iteratively calculates the next number by adding the last two numbers.\n3. The sequence is stored in a list, which is returned at the end.\n4. The example usage prompts the user for the number of terms and prints out the resulting Fibonacci sequence.\n\nYou can run this code in your Python environment, and it will generate the Fibonacci sequence based on your input.",
